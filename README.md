 An app that allows you to tag locations to remember positions of interest. This can be places like where you hide a time capsule or where you found a good look out spot. Another use could be a bit more practical like where you parked your car or where did you lock your bike. All you have to do is open the app and then hit Tag It. The app will automatically create a tag at your location. You are then able to give it a name. Later you can get the location back by using find it to see all your tagged locations. Just click on an item in the list and then you can use navigate to tag to help you get to your location. We are using both the Location API as well as the Google Maps SDK.
